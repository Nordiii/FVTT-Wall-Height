# Information
The original creator is https://github.com/schultzcole, I have no clue what I'm doing and I don’t know if I will keep this up to date.
I have no intention to develop more on this plugin (except for stuff I personally want) therefor this won’t be put up on FoundryVTT, you need to grab the manifest URL from here.

# Wall Height (Proof of Concept)

*If you enjoy this module, please upvote or comment on the [Gitlab Issue](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/1829) for it to be added to core so that this feature can get the support it deserves.*

Adds the ability to set wall height for walls so that tokens can look over them (or under them).

The top and bottom heights of the walls are configurable in the wall configuration dialog.

## Project Status

Wall Height was originally released as a proof of concept to show that just a feature was possible. At this time, I believe it has proven it's point and do not intend to release new features or updates to the module, unless a major bug is found. I *do* intend to update it for 0.7.x compatibility once 0.7.x is stable.

## Compatibility

This module is likely incompatible with modules which modify token vision.
