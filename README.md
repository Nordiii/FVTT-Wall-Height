# Wall Height (Proof of Concept)

Adds the ability to set wall height for walls so that tokens can look over them (or under them).

The top and bottom heights of the walls are configurable in the wall configuration dialog.

## Project Status

Wall Height was originally released as a proof of concept to show that just a feature was possible. At this time, I believe it has proven it's point and do not intend to release new features or updates to the module, unless a major bug is found. The project will be completely abandoned by me when 0.7.x is released to beta, and if it is not compatible with that update, I will unlist it from the website.

## Compatibility

This module is likely incompatible with modules which modify token vision.
